<h1>Personal CV</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is <b>Didenko Anton</b>, i'm DevOps trainee. Here you can see my first CI/CD deploy.</p>
<p>This site is deployed using GitHub Actions pipeline. It launches AWS EC2 instance via Terraform main.tf module, then creates and deploys Docker container inside EC2 instance via Dockerfile. The github repository with this site code checkouts inside container and launches the HTTP server using apache2. Also, the GitHub Actions pipeline updates the site code after every push to the repository.
<p>You can see source code at <a href=https://github.com/iSTKr/Symphony_test>My GitHub Page</a></p>
